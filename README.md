## React Practical - V - TODO-LIST

## Description of the task:

- Allow users to enter a todo
- Show all todos
- Allow users to remove a todo
- Allow users to mark a todo as completed
- Allow users to show date and time when the todo was created
- Allow users to filter completed and incompleted todos
- The list items created on a day should be available all the time, for the same day, and should not get removed on reloading. But if the user opens the list the next day, it should get reset with no items. For this, you will need to set the data in cookie/local storage with an expiration trigger.
